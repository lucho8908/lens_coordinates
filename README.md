# Lens Principal Component Analysis - LPCA

This repository provides implementations and code for the results published in the paper by L. Polanco and J. A. Perea, **Coordinatizing Data With Lens Spaces and Persistent Cohomology**, Proceedings of the 31 st Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry (CCCG), pp. 49-57, 2019. Available [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d0829c68728fc0001b48b99/t/5d9561eca0bfc672d81cb537/1570071023411/Lens_space_coordinates.pdf) or [Arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00350.pdf).

The main implementation of the methods is contained in the file `LPCA.py`.

The scripts in `lens.py`, `lens_f3.py`, `lens_L3.py` and `lens_isomap.py` replicate the results presented in the aformentioned paper.
